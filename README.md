Snake Console Game
This is a console-based game made with Python using various modules. The player is represented using ASCII characters. Points are represented by the letter O, and enemies by the letter X.

The map is an array created using NumPy, where all elements (player, points, enemies) are placed randomly. Both the size of the map and the number of points spawned on it can be customized.

Game Rules:
The map's size can range between a minimum of 4 rows by 11 columns and a maximum of 8 rows by 15 columns. These limits are set due to standard configurations. Using sizes outside of this range may cause issues during execution.
The number of points cannot exceed the total number of available spaces on the map (numRows * numColumns) for logical reasons.
Enjoy playing and feel free to explore the code!
